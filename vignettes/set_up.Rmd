```

Some workflows in `{ghactions4r}` take additional setup steps besides running the `use_*` function. Here is a guide on the additional steps to be taken.

## Setting up pkgdown

Follow the [steps to create a NOAA themed pkgdown](https://noaa-fisheries-integrated-toolbox.github.io/resources/noaa%20resources/NOAA-pkgdown/). Note that dependencies needed for a website can be included in the [`Config/Needs/website` section](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#sec-dependencies-nonstandard-config-needs) of the `DESCRIPTION` file.

## Setting up code coverage

`use_code_coverage()` is now deprecated; instead, use `use_calc_cov_summaries()`, which will allow you to see summaries of coverage on each push to the main branch and on pull requests to the main branch. It will also post a comment on pull requests with a summary of code coverage for the pull request.
