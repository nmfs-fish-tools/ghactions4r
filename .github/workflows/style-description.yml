# This action runs usethis::use_tidy_description() to style r code in an r
# pkg's repo. After styling, the changes are committed and a pull request
# (PR) to the branch the Workflow was started on is opened --- this PR
# contains the commit.

# Workflow inspired by:
#   - https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/routine.yaml
#   - https://github.com/rstudio/education-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto-pkg-maintenance.yaml
